It consists of the following elements:\n\n- `source`: A string representing the source file. This can be `undefined`.\n- `sourceOffsets`: Offsets in the source code.\n- `generatedOffsets`: Offsets in the generated code.\n- `data`: The data associated with this mapping. The type of this data is generic and can be specified when creating a `SourceMap` instance.\n\nHere is an example of a `Mapping`:\n\n```ts\nlet mapping: Mapping<MyDataType> = {\n    source: '.../sourceFile.ts',\n    sourceOffsets: [10],\n    generatedOffsets: [30],\n\tlengths: [10],\n    data: myData,\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, `myData` is of type `MyDataType`, which is the type specified for the SourceMap instance.\n\nRemember to replace `MyDataType` and `myData` with actual types and data that are relevant to your project.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
