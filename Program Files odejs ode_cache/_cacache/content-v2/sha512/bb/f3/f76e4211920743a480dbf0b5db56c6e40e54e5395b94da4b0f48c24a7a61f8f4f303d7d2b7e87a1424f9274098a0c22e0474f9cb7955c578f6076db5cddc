Useful if you want to access the frame for an error object.\n\n## use\n\n```javascript\nvar stackback = require('stackback');\n\n// error generated from somewhere\nvar err = new Error('some sample error');\n\n// stack is an array of CallSite objects\nvar stack = stackback(err);\n```\n\n## CallSite object\n\nFrom the [V8 StackTrace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi)\n\nThe structured stack trace is an Array of CallSite objects, each of which represents a stack frame. A CallSite object defines the following methods\n\ngetThis: returns the value of this  \ngetTypeName: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.  \ngetFunction: returns the current function  \ngetFunctionName: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.  \ngetMethodName: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function  \ngetFileName: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script  \ngetLineNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number  \ngetColumnNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number  \ngetEvalOrigin: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called  \nisToplevel: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?  \nisEval: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?  \nisNative: is this call in native V8 code?  \nisConstructor: is this a constructor call?  \n\n## install\n\n```shell\nnpm install stackback\n```\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T22:59:30.082Z","modified":"2022-01-26T22:59:30.082Z","0.0.2":"2012-10-20T00:56:54.591Z","0.0.1":"2012-10-08T18:08:07.982Z"},"versions":{"0.0.2":{"name":"stackback","version":"0.0.2","description":"return list of CallSite objects from a captured stacktrace","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"mocha --ui qunit"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/shtylman/node-stackback.git"},"keywords":["stacktrace","trace","stack"],"devDependencies":{"mocha":"~1.6.0"},"author":{"name":"Roman Shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","_id":"stackback@0.0.2","dist":{"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/stackback/-/stackback-0.0.2.tgz","shasum":"1ac8a0d9483848d1695e418b6d031a3c3ce68e3b","size":3165,"noattachment":false,"integrity":"sha512-1XMJE5fQo1jGH6Y/7ebnwPOBEkIEnT4QF32d5R1+VXdXveM0IBMJt8zfaxX1P3QhVwrYe+576+jkANtSS2mBbw=="},"_npmVersion":"1.1.62","_npmUser":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1350694614591,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1350694614591,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-16T17:39:10.913Z"},"0.0.1":{"name":"stackback","version":"0.0.1","description":"return list of CallSite objects from a captured stacktrace","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"mocha --ui qunit"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/shtylman/node-stackback.git"},"keywords":["stacktrace","trace","stack"],"author":{"name":"Roman Shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"license":"MIT","_id":"stackback@0.0.1","dist":{"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/stackback/-/stackback-0.0.1.tgz","shasum":"26c40dca3b4af5f3e5a8b493e0af34fdebe324fc","size":1479,"noattachment":false,"integrity":"sha512-p32ZnMo0yQ9L4eq9lVuIMPGFCpQb24MixIMnl89SjFKUWMKZpheQeAUiHCsPPB4ndzlJ8eNyB21cSwqbdUtjsA=="},"_npmVersion":"1.1.61","_npmUser":{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"shtylman","email":"shtylman@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"publish_time":1349719687982,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1349719687982,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-16T17:39:11.098Z"}},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
